## 3D Printer & Laser Cutter Room
### Terms
FDM: Fused Deposition Modeling

SLA: Stereolithography

SLS: Selective Laser Sintering

### Full Spectrum PS48 Laser Cutter
- Massive CO2 laser cutter that can cut & engrave on a variety of materials, such as wood, acrylic, and cardboard.

### Epilog Laser Cutter
- Smaller laser cutter, faster and more accurate then the full spectrum laser cutter, but with reduced cutting area.

### FLSUN SR 3D Printers
- Delta FDM 3D printers that excel at printing PLA and ABS quickly, with speeds ranging from 80mm/s to 200mm/s.

### Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D Printers
- Cartesian FDM 3D printers that can print PLA, ABS, TPU, and many other materials. Slower than the FLSUN SR 3D printers, but can be tuned for higher quality prints.

### Markforged Onyx One 3D Printers
- Cartesian FDM 3D printers that prints Onyx, a carbon-fiber/nylon composite filament. Onyx filament is micro carbon fiber filled nylon, which produces very strong, very durable, and slightly flexible prints. Filament is charged at-cost to the user.

### Formlabs Form 2 SLA
- SLA 3D printer that prints using a clear resin, allowing for extremely accurate, production-quality prints. Prints need to be washed in isopropal alcohol after printing. Resin is charged at-cost to the user.

### Formlabs Fuse SlS & Sifter
- SLS 3D printer that prints by fusing nylon powder together. This method allows for extremely intricate parts that don't need supports to be printed. SLS is charged at-cost to the user.

### Protomax Waterjet
- Waterjet cutter that can cut virtually any material. Uses a high-presure stream of water to propel abrasive through the material.

### Wazer Waterjet
- Waterjet cuter, with a larger bed and simplier interface then the Omax waterjet, but has a slower cutting speed.

# Values
The Makerspace has seven **core values** that we strive to uphold.
These values are the foundation of our community and are what we use to guide our decisions. 
All Stewards and members of management are expected to uphold these values.

They are as follows:

## 1. Student-Run
Students run and manage the space, making sure that we stay attuned to the needs of students.
Decisions around hiring, purchasing, and expansion should be made by students.

## 2. Experimentation
Users should feel welcome to experiment and try new things in the Makerspace.
Stewards on duty should be able to help users with their projects, but should also be willing to learn alongside them.

## 3. Welcoming Environment
Users can work on their projects at any time, in a non-judgmental space. 
The Makerspace is a 7C space, and that should be clear in all of our policies, marketing, and actions.
We understand that users may feel intimidated by technical machinery, but we want Stewards to be as welcoming and helpful as possible to bring all users into the space

## 4. Accessibility
We strive to create a space with low barriers of entry that is open to all, regardless of ability or background.
This includes providing funding for student projects, retaining stock of basic materials, and providing workshops to teach users how to use our equipment.

## 5. Community
We are a collaborative space where students, professors, and clubs from all of the 7Cs can come together and create.
Working together, helping each other, and sharing knowledge are essential elements of our community.

## 6. Curiosity
We value exploring how the different facets of creativity are fostered through the use of our equipment and supplies.
Users should feel comfortable asking questions and learning about the space and its equipment.

## 7. Constant Evolution
Our policies and values should grow and change with our community.
We should keep in touch with the student body and make sure that we are meeting their needs.

# Values
The Makerspace has seven **core values** that we strive to uphold.
These values are the foundation of our community and are what we use to guide our decisions. 
All Stewards and member of management are expected to uphold these values.

They are as follows:

## 1. Student-Run
Students run and manage the space, making sure that we stay attuned to the needs of students.

## 2. Experimentation
Students should feel welcome to experiment and try new things, with help and guidance from stewards.

## 3. Welcoming Environment
Students can work on their projects at any time, in a non-judgmental space.

## 4. Accessibility
We strive to create a space with low barriers of entry that is open to all, regardless of ability or background.

## 5. Community
We are a collaborative space where students, professors, and clubs from all of the 7Cs can come together and create.

## 6. Curiosity
We value exploring how the different facets of creativity are fostered through the use of our equipment and supplies.

## 7. Constant Evolution
Our policies and values should grow and change with our community.

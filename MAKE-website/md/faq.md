# FAQ

## What are the Makerspace hours?

The Makerspace is open to students 24/7, but we have stewards on shift from:

- 1-10PM Monday-Thursday
- 1-7PM Friday and Saturday
- 1-9PM Sunday

While stewards are on duty, you can check out tools/equipment and ask them for assistance.

You can also ask questions on the [Makerspace Discord](https://discord.gg/uveewgBmME)!

## What does it mean that the makerspace is open 24/7?

It means that the general space is open to use whenever you need it. If you have passed the safety quizzes to certain rooms, your swipe will work at all times and you can work in there as well. If you want to use any machinery, follow the buddy rule to make sure you are being safe.

## Why are some tools locked up?

Having the lock up cage allows the makerspace to have more expensive and more dangerous machines and tools that we otherwise would not be able to have. For the same reason the machine shop has hard close hours past midnight, it is not safe for folks to be using tools such as welders at early hours in the morning. If you do find yourself wanting to use tools such as a sewing machine after steward hours, you can ask a steward to check it out for you overnight. 

## What quizzes do I need to pass?

Everyone should pass the general safety quiz so they can use the space and check out tools. Beyond that, it’s up to you! You need to pass the quizzes for any room/machines you want to use. If the quiz is for a room, you should get swipe for that room within 5-10 minutes after completing the quiz. 

## How do I get swipe access to different rooms? 

You get swipe through passing quizzes. To get swipe to the general makerspace, pass the general safety quiz. For the 3D print room, pass the 3D print quiz ect. 

## Can I use the materials in the Makerspace?

Yes! Everything out on the floor is available to use. We only ask that if you are making a project for a class/club/other group that has funding through ASHMC you use those funds to buy your materials.

## How can I get funding for a project?

All 5C students have access to up to $50 worth of funding per semester. Separately, Harvey Mudd students have access to up to $200 worth of funding through the Brawn Grant. To apply, fill out [Student Project Application Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kx6-SK9kjsYsJHwgEySk4QmM7U9FWOxUmHo8a2_U0RQ) and email a PDF to makerspace-management-l@hmc.edu.

## Where is the Makerspace?

It is the ground floor of the McGregor Computer Science Center, which is on the corner of Platt and Dartmouth. Look for a large yellow sign that says Makerspace!

## What is the difference between the Machine Shop and the Makerspace?

The HMC Machine Shop is a facility with equipment and supplies for heavy-duty machining. It has a separate safety quiz and is only open during proctor hours. The Makerspace is open 24/7 to all students who have passed the Makerspace’s safety quiz, and has a variety of different machines and supplies.

## Can my club meet here?

Yes! If your club plans on meeting in the makerspace, we ask that you email makerspace-management-l@hmc.edu to make sure that the time does not conflict with other clubs. 

## What can a steward help me with?

Stewards are available to answer any questions you have and assist you with projects, safety quizzes, and checking out tools. They will also run workshops and be able to teach you how to use different tools and machines during their shift hours. 

## Is the Makerspace open to all 7C students, faculty, and staff?

Yes, the Makerspace is open to all 7C students, faculty, and staff!

## How can I apply to be a steward?

We hire stewards every semester! If you want to apply to be a steward next semester, fill out an [interest form here](https://forms.gle/YhVQA59cuWytMw559) and we will contact you when the application opens. Otherwise, keep an eye out for signs around the Makerspace for when we start accepting applications!  

## What kinds of 3D printing are free?

All FDM (filament) printing is free for personal use. If you are printing items for research or a club, please talk to a steward as you may be charged at cost for filament, or be asked to provide your own. Using the Markforged, SLA (Resin), or SLS (powder) printers are not free, and you will be charged for the cost of materials. 

## How can I hear about workshops?

You can hear about workshops and sign up for them through the Makerspace Google Site. We will post updates whenever one is scheduled. You can also hear about them through our instagram, [@hmcmakerspace](https://www.instagram.com/hmcmakerspace/)

## What does it mean that the Makerspace is student-run?

Student-run means that students are heavily involved in the leadership of the space. We have 6 head stewards who write the policies and make decisions about what materials and machines are available for use. The head stewards lead the steward team and run trainings.
